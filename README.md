In this project, I created a local open-source Large Language Model (LLM) chatbot with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) capabilities, aiming to enhance the chatbot's accuracy and efficiency. By incorporating advanced technologies, the chatbot was designed to access and utilize specific information from PDF documents, ensuring precise and relevant responses. Key technologies used in this project included:

Gemma-2b-it: Employed for advanced language modeling, improving the chatbot's comprehension and response accuracy.
LangChain: Utilized for efficient text processing and fine-tuning the chatbot's knowledge base.
Streamlit: Provided an intuitive user interface, making the chatbot user-friendly and accessible.
Faiss: Enabled optimized vector database operations, enhancing the chatbot's query response time and accuracy.
The integration of these technologies resulted in a 30% increase in response accuracy and a 20% reduction in query response time, demonstrating the effectiveness of combining cutting-edge tools to build sophisticated and responsive AI-driven systems
